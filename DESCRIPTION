Description: Functions for visualizing and analyzing Vectra Immunofluorescent
    data. Options for calculating both the univariate and bivariate Ripley's K
    are included. Calculations are performed using a permutation-based 
    approach. The permutation framework was proposed in Wilson et. al (2021)
